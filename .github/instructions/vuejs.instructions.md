# VueJS 3 Development Instructions

Instructions for building high-quality VueJS 3 applications with the Composition API, TypeScript, and modern best practices.

## Project Context

- Vue 3.x with Composition API as default
- TypeScript for type safety
- Single File Components (`.vue`) with `<script setup>` syntax
- Modern build tooling (Vite recommended)
- Pinia for application state management
- Official Vue style guide and best practices

## Development Standards

### Architecture

- Favor the Composition API (`setup` functions and composables) over the Options API
- Organize components and composables by feature or domain for scalability
- Separate UI-focused components (presentational) from logic-focused components (containers)
- Extract reusable logic into composable functions in a `composables/` directory
- Structure store modules (Pinia) by domain, with clearly defined actions, state, and getters

### TypeScript Integration

- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety
- Use `defineComponent` or `<script setup lang="ts">` with `defineProps` and `defineEmits`
- Leverage `PropType<T>` for typed props and default values
- Use interfaces or type aliases for complex prop and state shapes
- Define types for event handlers, refs, and `useRoute`/`useRouter` hooks
- Implement generic components and composables where applicable

### Component Design

- Adhere to the single responsibility principle for components
- Use PascalCase for component names and kebab-case for file names
- Keep components small and focused on one concern
- Use `<script setup>` syntax for brevity and performance
- Validate props with TypeScript; use runtime checks only when necessary
- Favor slots and scoped slots for flexible composition

### State Management

- Use Pinia for global state: define stores with `defineStore`
- For simple local state, use `ref` and `reactive` within `setup`
- Use `computed` for derived state
- Keep state normalized for complex structures
- Use actions in Pinia stores for asynchronous logic
- Leverage store plugins for persistence or debugging

### Composition API Patterns

- Create reusable composables for shared logic, e.g., `useFetch`, `useAuth`
- Use `watch` and `watchEffect` with precise dependency lists
- Cleanup side effects in `onUnmounted` or `watch` cleanup callbacks
- Use `provide`/`inject` sparingly for deep dependency injection

### Styling

- Use `<style scoped>` for component-level styles or CSS Modules
- Consider utility-first frameworks (Tailwind CSS) for rapid styling
- Follow BEM or functional CSS conventions for class naming
- Leverage CSS custom properties for theming and design tokens
- Implement mobile-first, responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Ensure styles are accessible (contrast, focus states)

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy-load components with dynamic imports and `defineAsyncComponent`
- Use `<Suspense>` for async component loading fallbacks
- Apply `v-once` and `v-memo` for static or infrequently changing elements
- Profile with Vue DevTools Performance tab
- Avoid unnecessary watchers; prefer `computed` where possible
- Tree-shake unused code and leverage Vite's optimization features

### Testing

- Write unit tests with Vue Test Utils and Jest
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Use `mount` and `shallowMount` for component isolation
- Mock global plugins (router, Pinia) as needed
- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
- Test accessibility using axe-core integration

### Security

- Avoid using `v-html`; sanitize any HTML inputs rigorously
- Use CSP headers to mitigate XSS and injection attacks
- Validate and escape data in templates and directives
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
- Store sensitive tokens in HTTP-only cookies, not `localStorage`

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes
- Manage focus for modals and dynamic content
- Provide keyboard navigation for interactive components
- Add meaningful `alt` text for images and icons
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

## Common Patterns

- Renderless components and scoped slots for flexible UI
- Compound components using provide/inject
- Custom directives for cross-cutting concerns
- Teleport for modals and overlays
- Plugin system for global utilities (i18n, analytics)
- Composable factories for parameterized logic
