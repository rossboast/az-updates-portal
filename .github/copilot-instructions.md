# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Provide **concise and summarized responses** - keep answers brief and to the point
- Focus on clarity and actionable information
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity
- Write clear and concise comments for each function
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable

## Response Format

When providing code examples or explanations:
1. **Keep it brief** - provide only essential information
2. Use code blocks with appropriate language syntax highlighting
3. Include inline comments only for complex logic
4. Provide one or two sentence explanations, not paragraphs
5. Focus on the specific question asked, avoid tangential information

## Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases
